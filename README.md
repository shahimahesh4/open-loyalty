## Quick install

This project has full support for running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/>).

Go to the docker directory:

```
cd docker
```

Execute bellow command to run application: 

```
docker-compose up
```

Before you start using Open Loyalty you need to define hosts in your local environment. Add host openloyalty.localhost as 127.0.0.1 in your system configuration file (/etc/hosts).
If you find any problems using docker (for example on Windows environments) please try our Vagrant recipe.

## Quick install with Vagrant

You should have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed prior to executing this recipe.

Then, please execute following commands:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --user=www-data exec php phing setup
```

That's all. Now you can go to admin panel [openloyalty.localhost:8182](http://openloyalty.localhost:8182).
Default login is **admin** and password **open**. You can also go to customer panel [openloyalty.localhost:8183](http://openloyalty.localhost:8183).

## Vagrant helpful commands

- `vagrant provision --provision-with sync` sync current dir
- `vagrant provision --provision-with build` rebuild docker base images

## Url access

After starting Open Loyalty it's exposes services under following URLs:

 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8182 - the administration panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8183 - the customer panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8184 - the merchant panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost - RESTful API port
 * http://openloyalty.localhost/doc - swagger-like API doc


## For developers

If you are developer and want to attach source code then you have to build base docker images:

```
./docker/base/build_dev.sh
```

and run containers:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Remember about setup database using bellow command:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml --user=www-data exec php phing setup
```

After starting Open Loyalty in developer mode it's exposes services under slightly different URLs:

 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/admin - the administration panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/client - the customer panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost:8081/pos - the merchant panel,
 * http://openloyalty.localhost - RESTful API port
 * http://openloyalty.localhost/app_dev.php/doc - swagger-like API doc

## Generate JWT keys

Running `phing setup` will generate the JWT public/private keys for you, but in case you would like to generate them "manually" use `phing generate-jwt-keys`.
